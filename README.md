# Data-Cleaning-Process-and-Dashboard-in-Excel-for-Bike-Sales
This project involves cleaning and preparing a dataset of bike sales for analysis, followed by creating an interactive dashboard in Excel to visualize the sales data. The goal is to transform raw sales data into a clean, structured format and then use Excel’s powerful visualization tools to create a comprehensive dashboard.
## Implementation Details:
1.	Data Collection:
o	Gather bike sales data from CSV files sources.
o	Import the data into Excel.
2.	Initial Data Exploration:
o	Use Excel functions like SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT to get an overview of the data.
o	Identify any obvious issues such as missing values or duplicates.
3.	Handling Missing Values:
o	Use Excel’s IF and ISBLANK functions to identify and handle missing values.
o	Fill missing values with appropriate data or use techniques like forward fill or backward fill.
4.	Removing Duplicates:
o	Use Excel’s built-in Remove Duplicates feature to eliminate duplicate rows.
o	Ensure that each sale record is unique.
5.	Correcting Inconsistencies:
o	Standardize date formats using Excel’s TEXT function.
o	Ensure consistency in categorical data (e.g., product names, categories) using functions like UPPER or LOWER.
6.	Data Transformation:
o	Create new columns if necessary and extracting from the column value.
o	Normalize numerical data and encode categorical variables if needed.
7.	Creating the Dashboard:
o	Use PivotTables to summarize the sales data by various dimensions such as product, region, and time period.
o	Create PivotCharts to visualize the summarized data.
o	Add slicers to the PivotTables and PivotCharts to allow users to filter the data interactively.
